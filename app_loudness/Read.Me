Digital Audio Application
=========================
This application takes as a staring point the app_usb_aud_l1 application,
and then between the Decoupler and the Audio Driver,
a DSP function is inserted to process the audio stream.

Originally the module_cascading_biquad module was used as the DSP function.

It is now a non-linear-gain transform (module_loudness).

See Read.Me in module_loudness for more detail

See associated descrip.txt files for potted history of code development.
