Digital Delay-line Application
==============================
This application takes as a staring point the app_usb_aud_l1 application,
and then between the Decoupler and the Audio Driver,
a DSP function is inserted to process the audio stream.

Created an application by calling delay_line_wrapper function from 'dsp' function in dsp.xc
Currently can be called with delay time in milli-seconds.

See associated descrip.txt files for potted history of code development.
