History of Delay-Line Module
============================
See Read.Me for project overview

9-AUG-2012
-----------
Got rudimentary reverb working using delay-line.
On USB Audio 2.0 Ref board only 58ms od delay available.
Output is fed into delay-line to create multiple echo's.

24-AUG-2012
-----------
Removed customdefines.h as board specific.
Rewrote to remove 'board specific' definitions. (E.g. DEFAULT_FREQ)

06-SEP-2012
-----------
Updated to allow parameters to be passed in from calling function (in dsp_delay.c)
Removed calculation of reverb tap ratios.
Introduced new configuration function to be called from .XC code, when parameters are changed

13-SEP-2012
-----------
Updated to pull in NUM_DELAY_CHANS, etc from Makefile
DELAY_SIZE now calculated based on NUM_DELAY_CHANS

17-SEP_2012
-----------
Updated to use common utility function increment_circular_offset()
