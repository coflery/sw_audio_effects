History of Delay-Line Module
============================
See Read.Me for project overview

9-AUG-2012
-----------
Got rudimentary reverb working using delay-line.
On USB Audio 2.0 Ref board only 58ms od delay available.
Output is fed into delay-line to create multiple echo's.

24-AUG-2012
-----------
Removed customdefines.h as board specific.
Rewrote to remove 'board specific' definitions. (E.g. DEFAULT_FREQ)
