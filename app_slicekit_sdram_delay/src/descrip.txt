History of SDRAM-Delay Application
==================================
See Read.Me in module_delay for full description

20-SEP-2012
-----------
Copied app_slicekit_delay to app_slicekit_sdram_delay and edited to include
modules module_sdram_delay and module_sdram_memory_mapper

01-OCT-2012
-----------
Reorganised code to remove Makefile definitions, to conform to xSoftIPTools requirements.
and to work with Ross Owen's new sc_i2s/sc_i2c modules.

03-OCT-2012
-----------
Got SDRAM Memory-Slice to work.
Created new sdram_io.xc file, to hold low-level sdram I/O functions.
Fixed addressing problem in sdram_memory_mapper.xc
Added init_sdram function to fill SDRAM with saw-tooth wave to check for correct initialisation.
Added read_active flag to sdram_delay.c to prevent reading of uninitialised memory.

08-OCT-2012

Rebuilt for xTimeComposer on New SliceKit board (*)
