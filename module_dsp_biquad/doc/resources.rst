Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------

This approximate memory usage for this module is (figures shown in Bytes):

* codememory: 14K
* datamemory: 2K

Computation
-----------
The BiQuad algorithm uses 6 multiples/sample on each iteration.
It is estimated that 24 multiples are possible at 48kHz sample rate.
This would allow 4 channels of audio to be processed simultaneously.
