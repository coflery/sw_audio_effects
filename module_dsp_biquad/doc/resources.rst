Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------
Used memory (Bytes) is about:
Core0: 19348
Core1:  5716

Computation
-----------
The BiQuad algorithm uses 6 multiples/sample on each iteration.
It is estimated that 24 multiples are possible at 48kHz sample rate.
This would allow 4 channels of audio to be processed simultaneously.
