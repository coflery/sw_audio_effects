History of SDRAM Delay-Line Module
==================================
See Read.Me for project overview

18-SEP_2012
-----------
Copied from module_delay, and updated to use double-buffering.
The input and output samples are stored in local (512 byte) buffers.
When these buffers are full/empty, they are written/read to main memory. 

02-OCT-2012
-----------
Added read-active flag to prevent reading of uninitialised SDRAM
