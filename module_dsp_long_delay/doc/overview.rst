Overview
========

This application creates long multiple echos of an input audio stream by feeding it into a delay line. This library makes use of the xSOFTip SDRAM controller component, and for an 8 MByte SDRAM, can delay a stereo channel by upto 20 seconds. 

The delay-line returns a set of delayed outputs, creating a multiple echo effect.
