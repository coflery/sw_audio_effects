History of Reverb Application
====================================
See Read.Me in module_delay for full description

-----------
Used previous app_delay to create app_reverb project.
The app_reverb project uses all 8 threads.
3 threads are used for reverb.
1 for Equalisation, 1 for Gain-control (Loudness) and the remaining one for 
control and delay functionality.

22-AUG-2012
-----------
Got first draft working with 3 reverb threads.
This is not a reverb as such, it just uses the existing modules in the following order:
module_delay,
module_biquad,
module_loudness
When is running on the USB Audio 2 Ref board, 
so there is only enough memory to do a 16 millisecond delay.
