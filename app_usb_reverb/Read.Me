Digital Reverb Application
==============================
This application takes as a staring point the app_usb_aud_l1 application,
and then between the Decoupler and the Audio Driver,
a DSP function is inserted to process the audio stream.
This DSP function uses 3 threads, one for Equalisation, 
one for Gain-control (Loudness), the remaining thread handles control and delay functions.

See associated descrip.txt files for potted history of code development.
