Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------

This approximate memory usage for this module is (figures shown in Bytes):

* codememory: 9K
* datamemory: 2K

Computation
-----------
The gain-shaping algorithm uses 2 multiples/sample/channel. It is estimated that 24 multiples are possible at 48kHz sample rate which means that it is possible to process 12 channels simultaneously at 48 kHz.
