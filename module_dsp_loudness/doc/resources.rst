Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------
Used memory(Bytes) is about:
Core0: 13504
Core1:  5716

Computation
-----------
The gain-shaping algorithm uses 2 multiples/sample/channel
It is estimated that 24 multiples are possible at 48kHz sample rate.
That implies it is possible to process 12 channels simultaneously at 48 kHz
