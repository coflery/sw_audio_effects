Resource Requirements
=====================

Available Memory
----------------
Used memory(Bytes) is about:
   * codememory: 9K
   * datamemory: 2K

Computation
-----------
The gain-shaping algorithm uses 2 multiples/sample/channel. It is estimated that 24 multiples are possible at 48kHz sample rate which means that it is possible to process 12 channels simultaneously at 48 kHz.
